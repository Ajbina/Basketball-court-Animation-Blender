# Basketball-match-Animation-Blender

This is an animation graphics project. A small Basketball match has been shown here.

## Getting Started

This project is developed in Blender. So any operating system supporting Blender can be used for running and further developing the project.

### Prerequisites

Blender

### Installing

Installing Blender
Blender is released approximately every three months. You can keep up to date with the latest changes through the release notes.

Support Requirements
Blender is available for download on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Always check that the graphics drivers are up to date and that OpenGL is well supported. Blender has a set of minimum and recommended requirements; so make sure these are met before trying to install Blender.

Download Blender
Blender offers two different binary packages; you can choose from a stable release or a daily build. The first has the benefit of being more reliable, the latter provides the newest features, as they are developed, at the cost of stability.

Latest Stable Release
This is a binary distribution of the latest version of Blender. It is considered stable and without regressions.
Daily Builds
This is a binary distribution of Blender that is updated daily to include the newest changes in development. These versions are not as thoroughly tested as the stable release, and might break, although they are official and usually not highly experimental.

Installing on Windows
Check the Downloading Blender page to find the minimum requirements and where to get Blender (if you have not done so yet).

Download the zip-file or msi-file for your architecture (64-bit is preferable if your machine supports it).

Install from MSI
The msi-file will run an installer to choose where to place Blender and to configure Windows to have an entry on the menu and to open blend-files with Blender. Administrator rights are needed to install Blender on your system.

Install from Zip
When choosing the zip-file you have to manually extract Blender to the desired folder, where you can double-click the executable to run Blender.

There is no installer to place Blender on the menu, but there is also no need for administrator rights. With this option, it is possible to have multiple versions of Blender without conflicting, as they are not actually installed on the system.

However, if you want a particular version to be registered with your computer the simply run blender -r from the Command Line.


## Running the tests

After installing when blender is opened a page comes with a 3D cube drawn in it. Left and right side of the window contains different options that can be applied on the cube. Thus the proper installation can be checked.
